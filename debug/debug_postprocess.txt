"The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.\nThe problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nThe premises are given in the form of a set of first-order logic sentences.\nThe conclusion is given in the form of a single first-order logic sentence.\nThe task is to translate each of the premises and conclusions into FOL expressions, so that the expressions can be evaluated by a theorem solver to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nExpressions should be adhere to the format of the Python NLTK package logic module.\n\n\n<PREMISES>\nAll dispensable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is dispensable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNo good things are bad.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not dispensable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nTEXT:\tAll dispensable things are environment-friendly.\nFOL:\tall x.
