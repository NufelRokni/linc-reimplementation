</s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s><s> The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.
The problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.
The premises are given in the form of a set of first-order logic sentences.
The conclusion is given in the form of a single first-order logic sentence.
The task is to translate each of the premises and conclusions into FOL expressions, so that the expressions can be evaluated by a theorem solver to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.
Expressions should be adhere to the format of the Python NLTK package logic module.
